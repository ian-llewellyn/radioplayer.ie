      <h1>Irish Radioplayer Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <dl>
        <dt>Where are my BBC stations?</dt>
        <dd>The Irish Radioplayer app has been licensed to RTE and the IBI for use by Irish radio stations. BBC Stations are not available through this app and should be recieved using an alternative method.</dd>

        <dt>Why do I get 'choppy' reception?</dt>
        <dd>If your connection to the internet is not adequate (minimum 64 kbps consistently), you will have trouble recieving flawless audio streams from most sources using any app. Fluctuations on the general internet can also lead to a deterioration, but this is less frequent.</dd>

        <dt>I can't hear anything. What should I do?</dt>
        <dd><ul>
          <li>Check that your device is producing sounds using another app.</li>
          <li>Try a speed test app or site.</li>
          <li>Contact the station you are trying to receive.</li>
        </ul></dd>

        <dt>Stations take a long time to buffer. How can I improve it?</dt>
        <dd><p>The performance of your device has a strong influence on how well the app appears to respond. Try closing other apps on the device to see if that helps.</p>

        <p>The internet connection can also affect how the app behaves. You can try changing connections to see if a more performant result can be achieved.</p></dd>

        <dt>How many stations are there?</dt>
        <dd>43, 9 of which are RTE Services and the other 34 are from the Independant Broadcasters of Ireland.</dd>

        <dt>Why is there no 'More from this station'?</dt>
        <dd>The more from this station is populated by stations' podcasts or other means of providing content. Not all stations are able to provide this material, but more and more are doing so as time goes by.</dd>

        <dt>Is the app available outside of Ireland?</dt>
        <dd>Yes, the App is available internationally in both the Google Play store and the Apple App store. Some stations may provide a different, or no stream at all if you are based outside of Ireland.</dd>

        <dt>Can I subscribe to podcasts in the App?</dt>
        <dd>The only way to subscribe to content in the app is marking a show as a favourite. Other than that, podcasts cannot be subscribed to natively in the app.</dd>

        <dt>How can I reduce my data charges?</dt>
        <dd>If you are within range of WiFi, connect to it to move your data usage away from your mobile operator. Phones vary, so we cannot give specific guidance.</dd>

        <dt>Is there better audio quality available?</dt>
        <dd>Most stations provide a better quality stream that is not accessible using mobile data. Connect to WiFi to gain access to these streams.</dd>
